## 📂 Project 1: NYC Airbnb Analysis
**File:** `airbnb.ipynb` | **Dataset:** `airbnb_listings.xlsx - AirBnB_NYC.csv`

This project performs an in-depth exploratory analysis of the Airbnb market in New York City. By cleaning and visualizing the dataset, we identify key factors influencing prices and listing popularity.

### 🔑 Key Analysis
* **Price Distribution:** Analyzing price variance across different boroughs (Manhattan, Brooklyn, etc.).
* **Room Type Analysis:** Comparing `Entire home/apt` vs. `Private room` availability and pricing.
* **Location Heatmaps:** Visualizing high-density listing areas using geographical coordinates.
* **Review Correlation:** Investigating the relationship between number of reviews and price.

## ⚽ Project 2: FIFA World Cup History
**File:** `Football_WC.ipynb` | **Datasets:** `WorldCups.csv`, `WorldCupMatches.csv`

This project analyzes historical data from FIFA World Cup tournaments (1930 - 2014), tracking the evolution of the sport through data.

### 🔑 Key Analysis
* **Attendance Trends:** Tracking stadium attendance growth over the decades.
* **Goals per Match:** Analyzing the offensive evolution of the game.
* **Winner Analysis:** Visualizing which countries have dominated the tournament.
* **Match Outcomes:** Statistical summary of home wins vs. away wins.
